# Momth

Momth is an app designed to assist working mothers in balancing their professional responsibilities with caring for their children. The inception of this idea occurred during a viewing of "Coraline" by myself and Milena Magalhaes, my partner in creating this application.

## Inspiration from "Coraline"

"Coraline" portrays the story of a young girl who stumbles upon an alternate reality where her family and friends are seemingly perfect. Initially enamored by this world, Coraline soon realizes that its inhabitants are actually villains. She embarks on a daring adventure to return home.

While immersed in the film, we were struck by the underlying theme of parental neglect due to work commitments, particularly in Coraline's case.

Motivated by this revelation, Milena and I resolved to develop an app to support mothers like Coraline's mother, Mel Jones, in effectively managing their schedules to balance work and parental duties.

## Design Concept

In crafting the app's design, we opted for a predominant green color scheme. Green symbolizes the reality that Coraline's mother, Mel Jones, faces â€“ one characterized by anxiety and melancholy. Additionally, this color choice pays homage to Mel Jones's occupation, as she works with a plant catalog.

Momth serves as a digital ally for mothers striving to maintain a harmonious equilibrium between their professional and familial roles.

## Programming

The programming language used for this challenge was Swift. As we developed the app, we utilized SwiftUI for the front-end and also implemented "Codable Extension," an extension created by Ricardo, to save the information provided to the app by the users.
